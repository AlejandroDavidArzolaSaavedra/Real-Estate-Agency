This project provided an overview of four programming assignments related to structured data and programming.


## Assignment 1: Linked List Container 📝

**Objective:** Developed a container class, `LinkedList`, to represent a collection of integers using a singly linked list.

**Implementation:** Created a class with operations like insertion, extraction, searching, and more, using a linked list structure.

**Testing:** Performed tests to ensure the correct functioning of the container without using JUnit.

## Assignment 2: Binary Search Tree Container 📚

**Objective:** Developed a container class, `BinarySearchTree`, to represent a collection of integers using a binary search tree.

**Implementation:** Created a class with operations such as insertion, extraction, searching, and more, using a binary search tree structure.

**Testing:** Developed a test class, `TestBinarySearchTree`, to check the correct functioning of the container without using JUnit. Conducted performance tests with specific requirements.

## Assignment 3: Binary Search Tree Container (Advanced)🔄

**Objective:** Extended the binary search tree container developed in Assignment 2. Focused on optimizing performance and conducting detailed performance tests.

**Implementation:** Implemented a binary search tree using a dynamic memory structure. Performed various operations and measured the time complexity.

**Testing:** Developed a test class, `TestBinarySearch`, to evaluate the container's performance and behavior under different scenarios. Performed detailed experiments and recorded results in an output file.

## Assignment 4: B-Tree Container 🌳

**Objective:** Developed a container class, `BTree`, to represent a collection of integers using a B-tree.

**Implementation:** Implemented a B-tree with specified orders. Utilized provided helper classes for file manipulation and conversion. Conducted performance tests with various orders and sizes.

**Testing:** Developed a test class, `TestBTree`, to ensure the correct functioning of the container. Performed performance tests using specific files and orders.

These assignments progressively built on each other, covering fundamental data structures like linked lists and binary search trees, and advancing to more complex structures such as B-trees. Through the assignments, students gained hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating the performance of container classes for structured data.
